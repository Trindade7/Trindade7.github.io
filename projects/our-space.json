{"html":"<p>I created this app as a gift for my significant other since\nWe are in a long distance relationship. The idea is that each week we write each other a card about us. The  app is now being expanded so other people can create their accounts and do the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tools-stack\">Tools stack</h3>\n<p>I used the <strong>Angular</strong>  framework for the frontend, with <strong>Typescript</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong>. The backend uses <strong>firebase</strong> for Authentication and database. I’m quite familiar with both which sped up the development process. Furthermore, since SEO is not a priority for this app, i.e. no SSR needed, I can host it on Firebase Hosting for free.</p>\n<p>For the styling, I wrote my own instead of relying on a library  because the project is quite simple, no fancy things required at the moment, and, no visual library seems to fit in well with the style I’m going for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"check-it-out\">Check it out</h3>\n<p>The project is open source and can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Trindade7/our_space\">GitHub</a>\nunder the MIT license.
