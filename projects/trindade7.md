The app showcases some of my work and has a blog where you can find articles related to web development and software development in general, as well as mental health posts.

The app is built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) a framework for building high-performance universal web apps. I chose this stack mainly because I wanted a static site with an app feel, with high performance without compromising the user experience nor the development simplicity. It's hosted on github pages, since it's free and perfectly suited for this use case.
