I created this app as a gift for my significant other since
we are in a long distant relationship. The idea is that each week we write each
other a card about us. I am now in the process of expanding the app so other people can
do the same.

### Software stack

I used the Angular framework for the frontend and firebase for backend because of
speed of development. For the css, I wrote my own instead of using a library because of
the simplicity and aesthetic I wanted for the app.

### Check it out

The project is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Trindade7/our_space) your are free to use/improve on it. To see the app in action check [here](https://isourspace.web.app/).
