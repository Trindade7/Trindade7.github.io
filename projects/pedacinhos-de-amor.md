I created this store for a baking business that allows the users to check what the bakers offers and place orders. The app can be easily ajusted to other product styles. Ufortunately the company that ordered it ended up closing ðŸ˜¥.

## Tool Stack

In this app I used **Angular** with **NG-ZORRO** UI components and **less** for the front end, and **firebase** for the backend. I also used a bit of Illustrator to create a few images.

For state management I created a simple Store since using something like NgRx would be overkill.

The app uses firebase to sign users in securely as well as a database and hosting service. you can check it [here](https://https://pedacinhos-de-amor.web.app/). As mentioned the company that ordered closed so you use it as a demo.
