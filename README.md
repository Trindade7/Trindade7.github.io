# Jos√© Trindade personal Webapp

I am a Software Developer with focus in Web and Cross Platform apps. Plus a sprincle of design, drawing and painting.

This repo contains my personal website and, my blog where you can find articles related to web development and software development in general, as well as mental health posts.

The app is built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) a framework for building high-performance universal web apps. I chose this stack maily for simplicity of development and speed; since I wanted a static app with high performance and development simplicity Svelte fit like a glove.
