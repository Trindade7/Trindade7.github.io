# [Jos√© Trindade](https://trindade7.github.io) personal Webapp

I am a Software Developer with focus in Web and Cross Platform apps. Plus a sprincle of design, drawing and painting.

This repo contains my personal website and, my blog where you can find articles related to web development and software development in general, as well as mental health posts.

The app is built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) a framework for building high-performance universal web apps. I chose this stack mainly because I wanted a static site with an app feel, with high performance without compromising the user experience nor the development simplicity.
